# sankey-layout

Sankey diagram layout algorithm written in Javascript, intended for use with d3.
See [d3-sankey-diagram](https://github.com/ricklupton/d3-sankey-diagram) if you
just want to draw Sankey diagrams; this package contains the layout algorithms
but no visualisation.

If you use the Jupyter notebook, try
[ipysankeywidget](https://github.com/ricklupton/ipysankeywidget).
